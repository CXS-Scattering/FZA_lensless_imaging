# FZA_lensless_imaging
The MATLAB codes allow simulation/experiment and compressive reconstruction of an single-shot lensless imaging using Fresnel zone aperture (FZA). They are based on the paper:

J. Wu, H. Zhang, W. Zhang, G. Jin, L. Cao, and G. Barbastathis, "Single-shot lensless imaging with fresnel zone aperture and incoherent illumination," Light: Science & Applications 9, 1-11 (2020).
