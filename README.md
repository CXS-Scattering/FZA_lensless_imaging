# FZA_lensless_imaging
This MATLAB code allows simulation/experiment and compressive reconstruction of an single-shot lensless imaging using Fresnel zone aperture (FZA). They are based on the paper:

J. Wu, H. Zhang, W. Zhang, G. Jin, L. Cao, and G. Barbastathis, "Single-shot lensless imaging with fresnel zone aperture and incoherent illumination," Light: Science & Applications 9, 1-11 (2020).

FZA_single_shot.m	- simulate the FZA imaging and reconstruction

FZA_single_shot_experiment.m	- reconstruct from experimental image
